In a lush green village, Kalu Singh,
a chief farmer, tended to his land with love. One day, his tractor broke down, and he needed a part. With no internet, he drove to town, only to find the shop closed. Just then, his son, a tech-savvy gamer, arrived, fixed the part online, and saved the harvest! 🌾💻 Kalu Singh beamed with pride, "Technology is the new farming!" 😊
